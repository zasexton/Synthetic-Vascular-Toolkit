SVT Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Welcome to the **SVT** documentation!

The **S** ynthetic **V** ascular **T** oolkit ( **SVT** ) is a cross-platform (pure-python),
object-oriented synthetic vasculargeneration library. It is compatible with Python
versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. It supports robust model creation and
multi-fidelity computational fluid simulation for arbitrary perfusion domains.

SVT provides easy-to-use, efficient data structures for storing and interpreting
vascular geometries for 3D fabrication and computational modeling. Coupled with
advanced algorithms for handling complex vascular manipulation, this module can serve
as an end-to-end toolkit for a wide variety of projects in vascular biology.
